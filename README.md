# NLP Final Competition - Team Wiki
ðŸ‘‰ *Published by HackMD: https://hackmd.io/@KoiSharp/rygtpQAL5*
## Proposal
- We will use [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [huggingface transformers API](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
### Baseline Proposal
- Vanilla BERT (Standard) as our baseline
- Only consider the conversations, exlude prompts
- Use Adam as our optimizer

### Master Proposal
- Use two BERT or DistilBert with different weights to infer `prompt` & `utterance` representationsï¼Œconcatenate the two hypotheses.
- Add a `LayerNorm` layer to receive the concatenated result.
- Use `Linear` layer to do classification.
- Maybe we can use `SAM` to smooth the loss landscape
